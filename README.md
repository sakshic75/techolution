# techolution
I have created 2 different Controllers
Requirement : Need to create a folder in C:// named as "techolution"


Port : 3000

FIRST CONTROLLER
Mapping : localhost:3000/

This will open a form for selecting the file from system.
After selecting the file,the file will be saved in C://techolution a folder called "techolution" is needed to get created in C: Drive

SECOND CONTROLLER
Mapping : localhost:3000/download

This will download the file in C://techolution
Default file I set is "Bigd.txt"
You can change the file name as per the system
